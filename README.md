FASTDial: Abstracting Dialogue Policies for Fast Development of Task Oriented Agents

FASTDial is built on top of OpenDial Framework. The dialogue management service of FASTDial heavily 
depends on the middleware interaction to retrieve the relevant information throughout the dialogue. 
The necessary middleware interaction is handled by using web service responses/Telegram midware KB simulation.
FASTDial produces 2-types of DMS outputs: i) Machine Utterance and ii) API call.
